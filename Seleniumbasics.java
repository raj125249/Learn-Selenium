/* What is ??
 * 		Selenium is a automation frame work it has lots of classes and methods, we can automate web based applications.
 *				UI(User Interface means user can access it) automation frame work which is used to interact web based applications.(browse through web applications)
 *					whatever applivations we are acessing/using via browser is called UI web applications || front end applications
 *  
 *  why selenium ??
 *  				Selenium is an OPEN SOURCE TOOL (selenium github an URL to access the selenium codes on the many languages.)
 * 									Transparency and Integration.
 * 
 * When to Use ??
 * 					Functional, Regression testing.
 * 
 * popular tools
 * 		selenium:		Core java, python, C#, java script, ruby, perl
 * 		playwright:		Core java, python, C#, java script
 * 		cypress:		java script

 * Selenium components
 * 
 * selenium 
 * 
 * selenium cannot do :
 * 			1. selenium cannot talk to database - if requires --> JDBC library.
 * 			2. selenium cannot talk to Excel(desktop application) - if requires -->	apache.poi
 *  		3. selenium cannot talk to mobile application- if requires --> appium.
 * 
 * How selenium works Internally:
 * 					
 * Automation scripts: what ever the work we do manual to make it auto matic via scripts (in java language) is called automated.	(login example)
 * the script written would interact with browser.
 * 
 * Driver is the communicator for the JAVA to browser eg: chromedriver//edgedriver
 * 
 * 3 things must needed
 * 			1. Selenium Library.
 * 			2. Driver (browserdriver)
 * 			3. Browser downloaded/Installed.
 * 
 * if the you want to place a driver into the system is not allowed to install then
 * the maven repository then we can use  "system.set property" [now a days its not used]
 * 
 * 
 * Difference b/w maven and java project is
 * 
 * 				java --> u have to download that specific jar file project.
 * 						
 * 				maven --> contains by default.
 * 						
 * 
 * how selenium internally works??
 * 
 * selenium internals:  going to write an automation scripts is going to written in JAVA language. this script interacts with the browser.
